# Code

This subdirectory contains the actual analysis code used to produce the results of all the different sector analyses of the paper. We divided the analysis into three different parts. The peak sector script to perform the peak sector analysis is `run_combined_pop_peak.py`. Other are similarly named for the power-law and reverse sector.

*Note: to run the code in this subdirectory, it is likely that you first need to download the data,
as specified in the `/data` subdirectory.*
