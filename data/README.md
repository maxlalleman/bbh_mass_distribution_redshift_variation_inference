# data

In this folder, you can find the notebooks in which all the figures are made for the corresponding paper, see here.

Per sector of the analysis, one notebook can be found in which all relevant figures, not all in the paper itself, are made.
Firstly, they show the computer parameter estimation cornerplots. Then, they look at the variation in the samples of all parameters as a function of redshift/mass.
After that, they compute the merger rate and the primary mass distribution for different redshift.
